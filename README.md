# Plasma Light ( a Plasma 5 "Megatheme")

## Intro

The idea of this "megatheme" is to provide an equivalent of Ozon OS Atom Shell extension set in Plasma. That is, as Gnome Shell extensions the closest thing conceptually would be plasmoids and manual configuration. Unlike shell extensions Plasma needs the user to manually place the panels and widgets to get X layout, the megatheme should be doing this by default.

## Goals

The megatheme should do the following after the user selects it on System Settings:

* Automatically place the Plasma panels at the top and bottom.
* Automatically place the correct widgets on these panels.
* Apply the Plasma theme and artwork (wallpaper, icons, color scheme, widget style).

## Differences with Plasma

Plasma 5 is a complete desktop shell, exactly like Gnome Shell is. Atom Shell although called a shell is not a desktop shell but a set of Gnome extensions. Plasma Light would be the equivalent of that.
